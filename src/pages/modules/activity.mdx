<PageDescription>

The **<SolutionName />** **Activity** module allows authorized users to
view metrics about their organization's data upload and network activity. Usage
data about products, facilities, users and data uploads is displayed, including
changes in activity, by week, month or year.

## How it works

The **Activity** module displays the latest activity from your organization by
collecting monitored data:

- Usage: organizations, users, unique logons and trace.
- Data upload: records, uploads and errors.
- Pallets shipped: pallets shipped to and from your organization.

Changes in activity are also indicated. Clicking on any graph or chart expands the view.
