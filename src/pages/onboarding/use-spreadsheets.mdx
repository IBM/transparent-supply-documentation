templates to facilitate uploading data in XML format.

</PageDescription>

## Usage notes

As one option for onboarding data, Microsoft&reg; Excel&trade; spreadsheet templates
are provided. Each spreadsheet template is unique to the data type, so you must use
the template (direct links provided below) specific to each data type:

* Products
* Facilities
* Purchase Orders
* Despatch Advice
* Receive Advice
* Events (Commission, Decommission, Observation, Transformation, Aggregation, Disaggregation)

**Note**: Each row in a spreadsheet file denotes a new asset.

Use the following procedure to upload data in a spreadsheet template:

1. Save the correct template file for your data type from the [convert
spreadsheets](convert-spreadsheets) page.
2. Open the template file in Microsoft&reg; Excel&trade; and save it as an Excel Workbook:
  (File -> Save As -> File Format: Excel Workbook (.xslx). An Excel&trade; Workbook
  is a collection of one or more worksheets (spreadsheets).
3. To populate data across worksheets, fill them out in the order prescribed by the
worksheet titles. For Purchase Orders, for example, enter the data in "Step 1 - Products"
first, followed by "Step 2 - Facilities" and "Step 3 - Purchase Orders". Note that some
templates only consist of one worksheet.
