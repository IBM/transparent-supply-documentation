<PageDescription>

Successful onboarding to **<SolutionName />** means registered users in
your **organization** have uploaded critical product supply chain
data&mdash;such as events and transactions&mdash;and shared them with
your selected <SolutionName /> business partners. Once your organization has
completed onboarding, you can start extracting value through additional <SolutionName />
[modules](/modules/modules-overview), such as [Trace](/modules/trace)
and [Documents](/modules/documents).
