<PageDescription>

To verify document authenticity and chain of custody, **<SolutionName />**
supports cryptographic signatures for all submitted XML. Signing of all XML documents
should be done using a supported algorithm (rsa-sha256 or ecdsa-sha256).

</PageDescription>

## Cryptographic signatures

For verification of signed data, the submitter must register public keys by submitting
a key registration document to <SolutionName />. The key registration document should
itself be signed using the corresponding private key.

Remove contact information fields from XML documents before cryptographic signing,
because subsequent modification of data by <SolutionName /> would invalidate the
signature provided by the submitter.

## Sample public signing key XML

Refer to the following sample public signing key XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ift:publicSigningKey xmlns:ift="urn:ibm:ift:xsd:1">
  <!-- XML message to communicate encoded public signing keys to IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply™.-->
  <!-- NOTE : Comments for a field appear BELOW the field. -->
  <keyID>12345</keyID>
  <!--Mandatory: Identifier for this public signing key. Should be unique (within your organization).-->
  <algorithm>rsa-sha256</algorithm>
  <!--Mandatory: Digital signing algorithm that this key should be used with.-->
  <!--Should be either rsa-sha256 or ecdsa-sha256.-->
  <encodedPublicKey>c7be1dd4d4899 ...</encodedPublicKey>
  <!--Mandatory: Encoded public signing key, represented as a base-64 encoded string.-->
</ift:publicSigningKey>
```
